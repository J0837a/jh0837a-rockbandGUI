The goal is to make a program that can do the following things: 

Take a YT URL and pull audio information from it in some way 
Take said audio information and be able to detected spikes in volume etc
Have a cool little bit of sprite art vibing to the music, its actions change based on volume 

Needed External Libs so far;
